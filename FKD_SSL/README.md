## Self-supervised Representation Learning Using FKD



### Preparation

- Install PyTorch and ImageNet dataset following the [official PyTorch ImageNet training code](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet).

- Download our [soft label](http://zhiqiangshen.com/projects/FKD/index.html) for SSL. 


### FKD Training on ReActNet & ResNet-50

The training code is similar to the supervised scheme, will be available soon.
